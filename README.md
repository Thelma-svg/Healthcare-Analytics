# Healthcare-Analytics
A Power BI project analyzing healthcare facility distribution, funding disparities, and emergency response times across African regions. Provides data-driven insights for policymakers and stakeholders.

## Dashboard Preview

## Data Source and Preparation  
- **Dataset Source:** AXIA AFRICA (provided for the assessment).  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:**  
  - Processed data in **Power Query** (removed duplicates, ensured consistency).  
  - Added three key columns:  
    - **Urban/Rural Classification** – Differentiates healthcare regions.  
    - **Funding Categories** – Groups funding into high, medium, and low.  
    - **Funding per Visit** – Measures facility efficiency.  

## Dashboard Design and Visualizations  
### Key Metrics:  
- **Total Funding Allocated:** $213M  
- **Average Response Time:** 32.41 minutes  
- **Average Visits per Facility:** 10.59K  
- **Facility Count:** Hospitals, Health Centers, Clinics  

### Visualizations:  
- **Facility Distribution:** Urban vs. Rural (bar chart).  
- **Funding Breakdown:**  
  - **77.41% funding** is allocated to urban areas.  
  - **22.59% funding** goes to rural areas.  
- **Funding Per Visit:** Horizontal bar chart.  
- **Emergency Response vs. Funding:** Scatter plot (shows no significant correlation).  
- **Response Time by Distance:** Line graph.  
- **Country-based Slicers:** For deeper analysis.  

## Key Findings & Insights  
1. **Urban areas have more healthcare facilities** (1,530 vs. 470 in rural areas).  
2. **Funding allocation is highly uneven** – Urban areas receive **77.41%**, rural areas get only **22.59%**.  
3. **Funding does not strongly impact emergency response time** (as seen in the scatter plot).  
4. **Rural areas have slightly lower funding per visit**, making accessibility a challenge.  

## Actionable Insights  
  **Bridging the Healthcare Gap:**  
- Increase **funding allocation** for rural areas.  
- Improve **rural healthcare infrastructure** and provide incentives for healthcare workers.  
- **Leverage technology & telemedicine** for remote healthcare solutions.  
- Optimize **data-driven funding allocation models**.  

## Recommendations  
✅ **Increase Rural Healthcare Funding** for balanced resource distribution.  
✅ **Improve Emergency Response** in underserved areas.  
✅ **Expand Rural Healthcare Facilities** to ensure accessibility.  
✅ **Use AI & Data Analytics** for predictive healthcare resource planning.  

## Conclusion  
This project presents a **comprehensive Power BI analysis** on healthcare funding and accessibility in Africa. By identifying disparities and inefficiencies, it provides **data-backed recommendations for improving healthcare equity and decision-making**.
